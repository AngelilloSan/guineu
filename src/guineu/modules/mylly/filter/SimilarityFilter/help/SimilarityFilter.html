        <h1>Similarity Filter</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This algorithm filters all compounds that have less similarity than the user-defined similarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user can choose between two kinds of similarity (maximum and mean) and the filter can
            delete the compounds or rename them to "unknown".
        </p>

            <dd>This text will be added to the name of the filtered version of the data set so

            <dt>Similarity used</dt>
            <dd>There are two options: maximum similarity (by defect) and mean similarity. One of
                these two similarities is used by the algorithm to filter the compounds.</dd>
            <dt>Action</dt>
            <dd>Compounds that meet the filtering criteria may be deleted or renamed to "unknown"
                by the algorithm </dd>
            <dt>Minimum similarity required</dt>
            <dd>The user has to set the similarity threshold.</dd>
