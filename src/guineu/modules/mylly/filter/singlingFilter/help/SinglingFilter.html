        <h1>Singling Filter</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The algorithm chooses between the compounds with the same name the one which contains the largest
            peak and also the peak nearest to the ideal based on its similarity. This two characteristics can
            correspond to the same peak and in that case the algorithm will leave only this peak and filter out
            the rest with the same name.
