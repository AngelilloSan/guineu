        <h1>Linear normalizer</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Linear normalizer divides the height (or area) of each peak in the peak list by a normalization factor, determined according to the Normalization type parameter.
            Each column (raw data file) of the peak list is normalized separately. In other words, normalization factor is determined independently for each raw data file.
