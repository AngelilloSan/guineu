        <h1>Linear Normalizer</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This algorithm normalize the intensities of the compounds using one or more
            standards compounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The normalization algorithm will be different depending on the numbers
            of standards selected by the user.        
            If there is only one selected standard, its amount will be fix to 100 and the
            rest of intensities will be change according with the standard:
        </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <b>[100 * Compound intensity]/[Standard intensity]
            </b>
        </center>


        <p>
            In the case that more than one standard have been selected, the algorithm will
            select the most appropriate standard for each row and it will be used to do the
            normalization as is explained above.
            The selection of the standard is based on the similarity of the first retention time.
