        <h1>Class Identification</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            the algorithm identifies the class of each compound based on its spectra
            and using some rules that the user must define in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
            The format of the file which contains the rules should be CVS file, and it
            should be like this:

        <p>
            This paper describes a language for expressing criteria for chemical
            identification with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography
            paired with mass spectrometry (GC× GC–MS) and presents computer-based
            tools implementing the language. The Computer Language for Indentifying
            Chemicals (CLIC) allows expressions that describe rules (or constraints)
            for selecting chemical peaks or data points based on multi-dimensional
            chromatographic properties and mass spectral characteristics. CLIC offers
            chromatographic functions of retention times, functions of mass spectra,
            numbers for quantitative and relational evaluation, and logical and arithmetic
            operators. The language is demonstrated with the compound-class selection rules
            described by Welthagen et al. [W. Welthagen, J. Schnelle-Kreis, R.
            Zimmermann, J. Chromatogr. A 1019 (2003) 233–249]. A software implementation
            of CLIC provides a calculator-like graphical user-interface (GUI) for building
            and applying selection expressions. From the selection calculator,
            expressions can be used to select chromatographic peaks that meet the
            criteria or create selection chromatograms that mask data points inconsistent
            with the criteria. Selection expressions can be combined with graphical,
            geometric constraints in the retention-time plane as a powerful component
            for chemical identification with template matching or used to speed and
            improve mass spectrum library searches.

        <h3>Selection language functions</h3>

        <table class="sample">
            <tr>
                <td>Selection mode</td>
                <td>Description</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Retention (dimension)</td>
                <td>Returns the retention time of the current object (either pixel or blob)
                    with respect to the chromatographic column indicated by the
                    dimension parameter (either 1 or 2 for GC × GC). For both blob-peak
                    and blob integration modes, the function returns the retention time
                    of the peak pixel. Retention time for dimension = 1 is expressed in
                    minutes and retention time for dimension = 2 is expressed in seconds.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Intensity (channel)</td>
                <td>Returns the intensity value of the indicated channel (m/z in a mass spectrum)
                    in the multi-channel intensity array of the current object (either pixel or
                    blob). If the indicated channel = 0 (or null), the function returns the total
                    intensity.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ordinal (channel)</td>
                <td>Returns the ordinal position of the indicated channel (m/z in a mass
                    spectrum) in the intensity-ordered multi-channel array of the current
                    object (either pixel or blob).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Percent (channel)</td>
                <td>Returns the intensity value of the indicated channel (m/z in a mass
                    spectrum) in the multi-channel intensity array of the current object
                    (either pixel or blob) as a percentage of the total intensity of the array.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Relative (channel)</td>
                <td>Returns the intensity value of the indicated channel (m/z in a
                    mass spectrum) in the multi-channel intensity array of the current
                    object (either pixel or blob) as a relative percentage of the largest
                    intensity value of the array.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The functions are used in expressions with comparative operators to express
            the selection criteria. The relational operators are: less than, less than
            or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, equal to, and not equal
            to. For example, in blob-peak expression mode, Retention(2)<1.0 selects all
            blobs for which the second-column retention time of the blob pixel with peak
            total intensity is less than 1.0 s. In GC× GC data with a 5 s modulation period,
            this would select all blobs for which the peak is in the first 20% of the secondary
            chromatograms. In pixel expression mode, Ordinal(14)=1 would select all pixels for
            which the intensity value of the pixel’s mass spectrum at m/z=14 is the largest
            intensity value in that mass spectrum.
        </p>
        <p>
            CLIC provides for addition (+), subtraction (–), and arithmetic negation (–) of
            values and parentheses for grouping arithmetic terms. For example, in blob-peak
            expression mode, (Percent(14) + Percent(28) + Percent(42)) ¡ 50 selects all blobs
            for which the sum of the intensities at m/z=14, 28, and 42 is less than 50% of the
            total intensity for the blob peak pixel.
        </p>
        <p>
            CLIC provides logical-and (&), logical-or (|), and logical-negation (!) operations
            and parentheses for grouping logical elements. For example, in pixel expression mode,
            (Relative(57)>20) & (Retention(2)>2.0) selects all pixels for which the intensity at
            m/z=57 is greater than 20% of the largest intensity value in the pixel mass spectrum
            and the second-column retention time is greater than 2 s.
