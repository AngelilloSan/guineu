        <h1>Coefficient of Variation</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The coefficient of variation (CV) is a normalized measure of dispersion of a
            probability distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation
            to the mean. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            The advantage of the CV is that it is unitless. This allows CVs to be compared
            to each other in ways that other measures, like standard deviations or root mean
            squared residuals, cannot be.
            The standard deviations of two variables, while both measure dispersion in their
            respective variables, cannot be compared to each other in a meaningful way to
            determine which variable has greater dispersion because they may vary greatly
            in their units and the means about which they occur. The standard deviation and
            mean of a variable are expressed in the same units, so taking the ratio of these
            two allows the units to cancel.  This ratio can then be compared to other such
            ratios in a meaningful way: between two variables (that meet the assumptions
            outlined below), the variable with the smaller CV is less dispersed than the
            variable with the larger CV. (<a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/coefficient_of_variation.htm">http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/coefficient_of_variation.htm</a>)
