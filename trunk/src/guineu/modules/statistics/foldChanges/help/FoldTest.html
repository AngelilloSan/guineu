        <h1>Fold Changes Test</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fold change is a mathematical operation describing how much two variables
            differ. It is the ratio of the final value and initial value (B/A),
            if the final value is larger. This differs from the change between two
            values, which is (B − A)/A, which can be re-written as B/A − 1
            in the respect that when the two values are identical the fold change
            is unity (100%, one-fold change is not used), while the change is nil.
        </p>
        <pre>
            x = measured value; y = control value --> Fold change: x/y
        </pre>

        <p>
            The algorithm uses as a "measured" and "control" value the mean of one group of
            samples chosen by the user.
