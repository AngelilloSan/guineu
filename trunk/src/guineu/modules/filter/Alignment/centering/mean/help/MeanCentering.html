                        This module centers the peak intensity in the mean of all the peak in every experiment. 
                        To do that the mean of the intensity of all the peaks is calculated for each experiment.
                        The value of each peak is calculated then by substracting the mean to the peak intensity
                        and taking the absolute value.
