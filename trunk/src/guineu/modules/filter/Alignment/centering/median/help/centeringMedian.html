                <p>
                        This module centers the peak intensity in the median of all the peak in every experiment.
                        To do that the median of the intensity of all the peaks is calculated for each experiment.
                        The value of each peak is calculated then by substracting the median to the peak intensity
                        and taking the absolute value.
